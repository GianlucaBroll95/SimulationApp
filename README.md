# GUI FOR SIMULATING BROWNIAN MOTION
## Authors: Michele Carone, Mattia Zuccotti, Yassine Aoukaili, Gianluca Broll

This a simple GUI for simulating basic Arithmetic and Geometric Bronwnian Motions. It is based on the Python library "tkinter". The use of this tool is very intuitive and allows the user to simnulate Brownian Motion, to determine the mean and variance of the simulated values at maturity and to calcualte customed probabilities. This is a first version of our project.
